                A student’s life is a foundation for learning. A student has to face all types of situations and is trained for the future. They learn to obey, respect and discipline themselves. They get to mingle with other students and teachers. A child’s character is shaped during this period. School life is the best and happiest part of every student. They live with no worries and tensions about the future. They play, make friends, learn skills, and live life to the fullest. It is the school where discipline is formed.
